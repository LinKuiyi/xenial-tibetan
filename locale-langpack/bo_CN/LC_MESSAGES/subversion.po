"\n"
"     If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working\n"
"     copy do not automatically cause a failure if the switch attempts to\n"
"     add the same path.  If the obstructing path is the same type (file\n"

"     versioned but its contents are left 'as-is' in the working copy.\n"
"     This means that an obstructing directory's unversioned children may\n"
"     also obstruct and become versioned.  For files, any content differences\n"
"     between the obstruction and the repository are treated like a local\n"
"     modification to the working copy.  All properties from the repository\n"

"\n"
"     Use the --set-depth option to set a new working copy depth on the\n"

"\n"
"     By default, Subversion will refuse to switch a working copy path to\n"
